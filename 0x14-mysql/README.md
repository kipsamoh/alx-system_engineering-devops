# Project Name.
**0x14. MySQL**


## Project Description.

Learn what is the main role of a database. What is a database replica.
What is the purpose of a database replica. Why database backups need to be stored in different physical locations. What operation should you regularly perform to make sure that your database backup strategy actually works.


* **0. Install MySQL** - Install mySQL on both your `web-01` and `web-02` servers. MySQL distribution must be 5.7.x.
* **1. Let us in!** - Create a user and password for both MySQL databases which will allow the checker access to them.
* **2. If only you could see what I've seen with your eyes** - In order for you to set up replication, you’ll need to have a database with at least one table and one row in your primary MySQL server (web-01) to replicate from.
* **3. Quite an experience to live in fear, isn't it?** - On your primary MySQL server (web-01), create a new user for the replica server.
* **4. Setup a Primary-Replica infrastructure using MySQL** - Primary must be hosted on `web-01` - do not use the `bind-address`, just comment out this parameter. MySQL replica must be hosted on `web-02`.
* **5. MySQL backup** - Write a Bash script that generates a MySQL dump and creates a compressed archive out of it. - `5-mysql_backup`.
