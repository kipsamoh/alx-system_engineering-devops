# Project Name.
**0x16. API advanced**


## Project Description.
Learn how to read API documentation to find the endpoints youâ€™re looking for
How to use an API with pagination. 
How to parse JSON results from an API.
How to make a recursive API call.
How to sort a dictionary by value.


* **0. How many subs?** - Write a function that queries the Reddit API[(https://www.reddit.com/dev/api/)] and returns the number of subscribers (not active users, total subscribers) for a given subreddit. If an invalid subreddit is given, the function should return 0. - `0-subs.py`.

  Requirements:

  * Prototype: `def number_of_subscribers(subreddit)`.
  * If not a valid subreddit, return 0.
  * NOTE: Invalid subreddits may return a redirect to search results. Ensure that you are not following redirects.
  
  Example:
  ```
  wintermancer@lapbox ~/reddit_api/project $ python3 0-main.py programming
  756024
  wintermancer@lapbox ~/reddit_api/project $ python3 0-main.py this_is_a_fake_subreddit
  0
  ```
---

* **1. Top Ten** - Write a function that queries the Reddit API[(https://www.reddit.com/dev/api/)] and prints the titles of the first 10 hot posts listed for a given subreddit. - `1-top_ten.py`.

  Requirements:

  * Prototype: `def top_ten(subreddit)`.
  * If not a valid subreddit, print None.
  * NOTE: Invalid subreddits may return a redirect to search results. Ensure that you are not following redirects.

  Example:
  ```
  wintermancer@lapbox ~/reddit_api/project $ python3 0-main.py programming
  756024
  wintermancer@lapbox ~/reddit_api/project $ python3 0-main.py this_is_a_fake_subreddit
  0
  ```
---

* **2. Recurse it!** - Write a recursive function that queries the Reddit API and returns a list containing the titles of all hot articles for a given subreddit. If no results are found for the given subreddit, the function should return None. - `2-recurse.py`.

  Requirements:

  * Prototype: `def recurse(subreddit, hot_list=[])`.
  * Follow previous tasks requirements.

  Example:
  ```
  wintermancer@lapbox ~/reddit_api/project $ python3 2-main.py programming
  932
  wintermancer@lapbox ~/reddit_api/project $ python3 2-main.py this_is_a_fake_subreddit
  None
  ```
---

* **3. Count it!** - Write a recursive function that queries the Reddit API, parses the title of all hot articles, and prints a sorted count of given keywords (case-insensitive, delimited by spaces. `Javascript` should count as `javascript`, but `java` should not). - `100-count.py`.

  Requirements:

  * Prototype: `def count_words(subreddit, word_list)`.
  * Note: You may change the prototype, but it must be able to be called with just a subreddit supplied and a list of keywords. AKA you can add a counter or anything else, but the function must work without supplying a starting value in the main.
  * If `word_list` contains the same word (case-insensitive), the final count should be the sum of each duplicate (example below with `java`).
  * Results should be printed in descending order, by the count, and if the count is the same for separate keywords, they should then be sorted alphabetically (ascending, from A to Z). Words with no matches should be skipped and not printed. Words must be printed in lowercase.
  * Results are based on the number of times a keyword appears, not titles it appears in. `java java java` counts as 3 separate occurrences of `java`.
  * To make life easier, `java.` or `java!` or `java_` should not count as `java`
  * If no posts match or the subreddit is invalid, print nothing.
  * Follow previous tasks requirements.

  Example:
  ```
  bob@dylan $ python3 100-main.py programming 'react python java javascript scala no_results_for_this_one'
  java: 27
  javascript: 20
  python: 17
  react: 17
  scala: 4
  bob@dylan $ python3 100-main.py programming 'JavA java'
  java: 54
  bob@dylan $ python3 100-main.py not_a_valid_subreddit 'python java javascript scala no_results_for_this_one'
  bob@dylan $ python3 100-main.py not_a_valid_subreddit 'python java'
  bob@dylan $ 
  ```
